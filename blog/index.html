From Canadian companies like Shopify, Kik and Thalmic Labs to big-name Silicon Valley companies such as Google, Microsoft and Apple to startups going through Y-Combinator, you&#39;ll find students from the University of Waterloo. I think this is fantastic, and I am very pleased to be a part of it all. </p>

subclasses are often the largest and most complex source code files in a project
repository.  Complexity arises naturally from the nature of the features that
controllers contain; syncing up to multiple data sources to show content to a
user, performing image processing in the background, etc. This makes
<code>UIViewController</code> a prime candidate for careful modular design. </p>

Though we have an extensive music library, sometimes the internet is our friend when it comes to music: some songs might only be available on youtube, for example. I use the 8tracks platform a lot at home and on the go to listen to music when I don&#8217;t feel like making up a playlist. This post will be about our method of queueing youtube videos and also the 8tracks mpd client which I wrote today.<!-- more --></p></p>
